# Senseware - Alerting a Deaf Person from Danger
"Senseware" is an innovative project dedicated to enhancing the safety and independence of deaf individuals in potentially hazardous situations. This mobile application leverages  sound analysis techniques to detect and alert users to external dangers. As a contributor to this initiative, I played a pivotal role in developing key features, including creating a dashboard, danger proximity assessment, danger level identification, and real-time direction indication of potential threats.
